This is supposed to be a template to use with nos2x extension login to your .NET 8 Blazor Web Application.

You will need to have a database running for it to work but while building the connectionstring just uses the built in SQL sheit.
Just run:
```Update-Database``` in Package Manager Console ( Visual Studio ).

Then start the project and build beautiful stuff on top of it!
